My name is Jeremie Dam. I hold a Master of Engineering and I serve as Director of Astek Vietnam. In this capacity, I work closely with senior engineers and technical leads delivering distributed, enterprise scale systems, and I am familiar with the level of rigor required to modernize platforms that operate across multiple markets.
